## Naming Strategy Types

- **Literal**: Direct, descriptive names that state exactly what the item is (e.g., *Black*, *Cotton*).
- **Interpretive**: Names that suggest a feeling, mood, or sensory quality rather than a literal descriptor (e.g., *Whipped*, *Amalfi*).
- **Referential**: Names that borrow from cultural objects, foods, or places to make an association (e.g., *Neapolitan*, *Taffy*).
- **Mix (Interpretive + Literal)**: A combination where part of the name is literal and part interpretive (e.g., *Cloud Cotton* where "Cloud" is interpretive and "Cotton" is literal).
