# Negative Namer

A web app that uses OpenAI to generate negative/pessimistic names for things. Built with Vite for hot reload development.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can enter your API key directly in the web interface.

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser

## Usage

- If you've set up the API key in `.env`, you can start chatting immediately
- Otherwise, enter your OpenAI API key in the interface
- Ask for negative names for anything and the AI will provide creative, pessimistic alternatives!
